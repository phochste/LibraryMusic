Description:

This is a small project I did in 2010 to create music from 
library statistics using the Processing language. In this
demo I transform one day of library circulation data. Every
requested call number is mapped to a library floor level.
We use Ghent Univerity Library as a model: it has 20 floors.
Each floor is a note on the pentatonic scale. When lending
requests happen in less then 15 minutes, then this will be
chord.

Java is required to run the applet in a web browser.
